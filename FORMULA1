Running out of ideas to write here. 
well would this work? (friday night with chinese food)
Ha this is cool, so procedure as follows:

Change/create some file in a repo named as the one on github.
git add 'file.ext'
git commit -m "some comment"
git push origin master
Username
Password


Now you have to set the origin, only once I assume. 
git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/repo.git

Question left:
Someone changed a file on github. How do I automatically update the file I have in my local repo?
How to manage branch control from the terminal (well happens only so often, use your mouse for once)
git fetch 
git checkout 'file'
